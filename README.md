# CMA-Boston
The Boston`s MASS data includes variables related to the housing price for the Boston area and periphery in 1970. 

An R file was developed and standarized to form a sort of template - that is, minimum effort is required to replace some core data variables such as the data frame in question, the proportion for $\Omega_{test}$ and $\Omega_{train}$ among some others.

As it starts as a formal assignment for my master's degree, there is constant mention about exercises to be completed. For that end, I will include information about the results in the form of a LaTeX document (just the pdf, not the actual code, although it can be uploaded as requested)
